# First Assignment

## Assignment Specification
Each student should develop one user interface element ( What are UI elements? See [here](http://semantic-ui.com/modules/search.html)! ). You need to choose **one** of the following four options to develop as for your assignment. Go to each of their readme pages to find out about their requirements.
* [**A Slider/Carousel Element**](https://github.com/web-advanced-fall-2016/assignment-1-spec/blob/master/README-SLIDER.md)
* [**An Accordion Element**](https://github.com/web-advanced-fall-2016/assignment-1-spec/blob/master/README-ACCORDION.md)
* [**A Modal Element**](https://github.com/web-advanced-fall-2016/assignment-1-spec/blob/master/README-MODAL.md)
* [**A Search Field Element With Dropdown for Suggestions From Static Data**](https://github.com/web-advanced-fall-2016/assignment-1-spec/blob/master/README-SEARCH-SUGGESTION-DROPDOWN.md) (long name! sorry! it's simple tho)

If you were interested in developing other UI elements other than these four options, let me know and we'll make that work.
